Welcome to Caesar Cipher, your gateway to the world of encryption, where ancient Roman mystique meets cutting-edge security! üèõÔ∏è

## Unveiling Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher, a time-honored encryption technique, traces its origins back to the days of Julius Caesar himself. It's a powerful method that involves shifting letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions to encode and decode messages. Now, with this exceptional package, you can harness the power of Caesar Cipher to protect your messages with ease and style.

## Astonishing Features

‚ú® **Effortless Encryption:** Encrypt and decrypt messages with unmatched simplicity.
üîí **Tailored Shifts:** Customize your shift value for unparalleled security.
<!-- üåê **Alphabet Agnostic:** Compatible with any alphabet, not limited to English. -->
üíª **Node.js & TypeScript Ready:** Seamlessly integrate it into your Node.js and TypeScript projects, complete with autocompletion!

## Installation

To embark on your encryption journey with Caesar Cipher, simply install it in your Node.js or TypeScript project using npm:

```bash
npm install caesar-crypt
```

## How to Use

1. **Import the Package:**

   In your Node.js or TypeScript script, import the `caesar-crypt` package with full TypeScript autocompletion:

   ```typescript
   import { caesarEncrypt, caesarDecrypt } from 'caesar-crypt';
   ```

2. **Encrypt Your Message:**

   Employ the `caesarEncrypt` function to encrypt your message. The default shift is set to 3 if not specified:

   ```typescript
   const encryptedMessage = caesarEncrypt('Hello, World!', 5); // Shift by 5 positions
   console.log('Encrypted Message:', encryptedMessage);
   ```

3. **Decrypt with Precision:**

   To decrypt the message, employ the `caesarDecrypt` function with the same shift value:

   ```typescript
   const decryptedMessage = caesarDecrypt(encryptedMessage, 5); // Shift by 5 positions
   console.log('Decrypted Message:', decryptedMessage);
   ```

Congratulations! You're now armed with the tools of a master encryption agent, ready to safeguard your messages with style and sophistication! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
